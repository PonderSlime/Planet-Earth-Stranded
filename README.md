# Planet-Earth-Stranded
This is my submission for the Hack Club: Arcade program that occured the summer of 2024

For the Animation previews, these are located [here](Samples)

Planet Earth: Stranded is an open-world game where you explore and collect scraps to re-establish contact with the space colony. 

You play as a robot that has been knocked off of the station and crash landed in Canada. Your mission is to explore and collect scraps to build and upgrade structures like communication towers. Since this is an open world game, climbing cliffs and swimming in the ocean will be eventually added. As a player, you will encounter hardships, such as keeping your robot charged up and repaired. More features to be added later.
